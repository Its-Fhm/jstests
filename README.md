# A test-driven JS assessment
This repo contains a set of tests that will test your JavaScript skills.

## Requirements
We are testing this on **Node 4.2.4+** Please ensure you have a matching version.

## How to get going

    npm install
    npm run setup
    npm start

Once you've cloned the repository, you should change into that folder and run
`npm install` from the terminal. That will ensure all the required software is
available.
`npm run setup` will install the latest version of browser-sync to
your machine.
`npm start` will run browser-sync and open a browser session.


The files in `tests/app/*.js` will serve to help highlight what the code is
trying to do, and much of that will be available from the web-page if you click
on the failed tests, but you are not meant to bring any changes to any files
outside `app/*.js`.


Objective: To pass all the tests that originally failed. Unit test work. Old project
